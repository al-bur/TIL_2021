### 2.1 what is the definition of bubble sort?



> Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.

### 2.2 Performance

---

Bubble sort has a worst-case and average complexity of *[О](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_o_notation)*(*n*2), where *n* is the number of items being sorted. Most practical sorting algorithms have substantially better worst-case or average complexity, often *O*(*n* log *n*). Even other *О*(*n*2) sorting algorithms, such as [insertion sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort), generally run faster than bubble sort, and are no more complex. Therefore, bubble sort is not a practical sorting algorithm.

The only significant advantage that bubble sort has over most other algorithms, even [quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort), but not [insertion sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort), is that the ability to detect that the list is sorted efficiently is built into the algorithm. When the list is already sorted (best-case), the complexity of bubble sort is only *O*(*n*). By contrast, most other algorithms, even those with better [average-case complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average-case_complexity), perform their entire sorting process on the set and thus are more complex. However, not only does [insertion sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort) share this advantage, but it also performs better on a list that is substantially sorted (having a small number of [inversions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_(discrete_mathematics))). Additionally, if this behavior is desired, it can be trivially added to any other algorithm by checking the list before the algorithm runs.

Bubble sort should be avoided in the case of large collections. It will not be efficient in the case of a reverse-ordered collection.

### 2.3 Use

Due to its simplicity, bubble sort is often used to introduce the concept of an algorithm, or a sorting algorithm, to introductory [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) students. However, some researchers such as [Owen Astrachan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Astrachan) have gone to great lengths to disparage bubble sort and its continued popularity in computer science education, recommending that it no longer even be taught.

Bubble sort also interacts poorly with modern CPU hardware. It produces at least twice as many writes as insertion sort, twice as many cache misses, and asymptotically more [branch mispredictions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_predictor).[*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] Experiments by Astrachan sorting strings in [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) show bubble sort to be roughly one-fifth as fast as an insertion sort and 70% as fast as a [selection sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort).[[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort#cite_note-Astrachan2003-4)

In computer graphics bubble sort is popular for its capability to detect a very small error (like swap of just two elements) in almost-sorted arrays and fix it with just linear complexity (2*n*). For example, it is used in a polygon filling algorithm, where bounding lines are sorted by their *x* coordinate at a specific scan line (a line parallel to the *x* axis) and with incrementing *y* their order changes (two elements are swapped) only at intersections of two lines. Bubble sort is a stable sort algorithm, like insertion sort.

In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), **counting sort** is an [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) for [sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm) a collection of objects according to keys that are small [integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer); that is, it is an [integer sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_sorting) algorithm. It operates by counting the number of objects that have each distinct key value, and using arithmetic on those counts to determine the positions of each key value in the output sequence. Its running time is linear in the number of items and the difference between the maximum and minimum key values, so it is only suitable for direct use in situations where the variation in keys is not significantly greater than the number of items. However, it is often used as a subroutine in another sorting algorithm, [radix sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort), that can handle larger keys more efficiently.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_sort#cite_note-clrs-1)[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_sort#cite_note-edmonds-2)[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_sort#cite_note-sedgewick-3)

Because counting sort uses key values as indexes into an array, it is not a [comparison sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_sort), and the [Ω](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation#Family_of_Bachmann.E2.80.93Landau_notations)(*n* log *n*) [lower bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_bound) for comparison sorting does not apply to it.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_sort#cite_note-clrs-1) [Bucket sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_sort) may be used for many of the same tasks as counting sort, with a similar time analysis; however, compared to counting sort, bucket sort requires [linked lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list), [dynamic arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_array) or a large amount of preallocated memory to hold the sets of items within each bucket, whereas counting sort instead stores a single number (the count of items) per bucket.[[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_sort#cite_note-knuth-4)
